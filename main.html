	<h1>Time complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) measures how efficiently an algorithm solves a problem based on input size. It quantifies the computational resources required, influencing algorithm selection for optimal performance. Algorithms with lower time complexity are more efficient, executing faster with larger datasets. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that deliver timely results across diverse computational tasks and real-world applications.</p>
    <h1>Space Complexity</h1>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) quantifies the amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the size of its input, denoted by <b>O(n)</b>. Efficient algorithms aim for minimal space complexity to optimize memory usage as input size grows. Understanding space complexity is crucial for developing algorithms that efficiently manage memory resources, ensuring optimal performance and scalability across various computational tasks.</p>
